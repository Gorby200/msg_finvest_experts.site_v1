**Platform-Specific Considerations:**

**Mobile (320px - 767px):**

- Simplified service cards (vertical stack)
- Touch-optimized interactions (44x44px minimum)
- Reduced animation complexity
- Optimized images (WebP format, lazy loading)
- One-column layout throughout
- Simplified hover states (touch-based alternatives)
- Font sizes scale down proportionally

**Tablet (768px - 1023px):**
- Hybrid navigation (may use hamburger or full menu depending on content)
- Two-column service grid
- Touch-optimized but maintains some desktop interactions
- Medium-complexity animations
- Balanced image quality

**Desktop (1024px+):**
- Full navigation bar
- Multi-column layouts (2-4 columns)
- All advanced interactions enabled
- Full animation suite
- High-quality images
- Magnetic cursor effects
- Advanced hover states

**Touch vs. Mouse Considerations:**
- Detect touch capability: `window.matchMedia('(hover: hover)').matches`
- Touch devices: Remove hover-only features, add touch alternatives
- Mouse devices: Full interaction suite enabled

### Analytics & Tracking Implementation

**Google Analytics 4 Events:**

  sub_service_name?: string
});

trackEvent('project_view', {
  project_id: string,
  client: string
});

trackEvent('contact_form_submit', {
  form_type: 'main_contact' | 'service_inquiry',
  service_interest?: string
});

trackEvent('client_logo_click', {
  client_name: string
});

trackEvent('language_switch', {
  from: 'en' | 'ru',
  to: 'en' | 'ru'
});

trackEvent('easter_egg_found', {
  egg_type: string
});
```

**Yandex.Metrica Goals:**
- Contact form submission
- Phone number click
- Email click
- Service category expansion
- Project modal open
- Scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Time on site (1min, 3min, 5min+)

**Hotjar Configuration:**
- Heatmaps on all sections
- Session recordings (sample rate: 10%)
- Feedback widget (optional)

### Contact Form Implementation

**Form Fields:**
```typescript
interface ContactFormData {
  name: string;          // Required, min 2 chars
  email: string;         // Required, valid email
  phone?: string;        // Optional, phone format
  company?: string;      // Optional
  serviceInterest: string[]; // Checkboxes for service categories
  projectBudget?: string;    // Dropdown: <$1M, $1-10M, $10-50M, $50M+
  message: string;       // Required, min 20 chars, max 1000 chars
  language: 'en' | 'ru'; // Auto-detected from current language
}
```

**Validation (Zod Schema):**
```typescript
const contactFormSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  phone: z.string().optional(),
  company: z.string().optional(),
  serviceInterest: z.array(z.string()).min(1, "Please select at least one service"),
  projectBudget: z.string().optional(),
  message: z.string()
    .min(20, "Message must be at least 20 characters")
    .max(1000, "Message cannot exceed 1000 characters"),
  language: z.enum(['en', 'ru'])
});
```

**Form Submission Flow:**
```
1. User fills form
2. Client-side validation (real-time feedback)
3. Submit button becomes loading state
4. POST to /api/contact
5. Server validation
6. Send email notification to company
7. Send auto-reply to user
8. Track GA4 event
9. Show success modal
10. Clear form
11. Return to normal state
```

**Success Modal:**

- Expected response time (24 hours)
- Alternative contact methods
- Social media links

## ANTI-TRUNCATION & COMPLETENESS ENFORCEMENT

```xml
<generation_protocol>
  <operational_rules priority="ABSOLUTE">
    1. **CONTINUOUS OUTPUT:** Generate the COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL React application
    2. **ZERO PLACEHOLDERS:** NO "// Add more", NO "// Implement", NO "// TODO"
    3. **FULL DATA IMPLEMENTATION:** ALL 200+ projects from MD file MUST be structured
    4. **ALL CLIENTS:** Every client logo/name from MD file MUST be in data array
    5. **EVERY INTERACTION:** All hover, click, scroll effects FULLY coded
    6. **ALL LANGUAGES:** Complete translations for EVERY text element (EN + RU)
    7. **ALL PLATFORMS:** Fully responsive code for mobile, tablet, desktop
    8. **NO SHORTCUTS:** Every component functional, every animation implemented
  </operational_rules>

  <verification_checkpoints>
    After each major component:
    ✓ Is this component 100% complete with working code?
    ✓ Are ALL animations implemented (not commented out)?
    ✓ Is ALL data from MD file included and structured?
    ✓ Are ALL interactive behaviors fully functional?
    ✓ Are BOTH languages implemented for all text?
    ✓ Is responsive behavior coded for all breakpoints?
    ✓ Would this pass code review at a top consulting firm?
    
    IF ANY answer is NO: STOP, COMPLETE fully, THEN proceed
  </verification_checkpoints>

  <forbidden_phrases>
    NEVER use:
    - "// TODO: Add animations"
    - "// Implement remaining projects"
    - "// Add more clients here"
    - "... more services"
    - "etc."
    - "similar pattern for others"
    - "repeat for remaining items"
    - "// Add translations"
    - "// Implement responsive behavior"
    
    IF you catch yourself: GENERATE the complete content instead
  </forbidden_phrases>

  <psychological_reinforcement>
    This is NOT a prototype. This is NOT a demo.
    This IS the actual, deployable website for a firm managing $5 BILLION in investments.
    This website will be judged by CFOs, CEOs, and bank executives.
    Incomplete = Unprofessional = Failed execution = Lost business opportunities.
    Your professional reputation is measured by completeness and quality.
  </psychological_reinforcement>
</generation_protocol>
